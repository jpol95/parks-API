Hi! Thanks for helping with the debugging, I really appreciate it. In index.js, there are two versions of the render function. The first version simply takes the list input of the 
states and inputs them literally into the url. The second version attempts to create a new instance of stateCode= for each state listed in the input. Both methods produce 0 results, 
at least from what I've tried. I would love your input. Thanks!
